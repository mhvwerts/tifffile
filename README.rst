=============================================================================================
Fork of a former version of tifffile.py
=============================================================================================

This forks version 2018.06.15 of tifffile.py (by
`Christoph Gohlke <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/>`_).
It is the last version to be
'self-contained' and portable, not having any dependencies other than 
numpy and matplotlib, and the Python standard library. There is an optional C 
module for speed-up, which can be readily compiled under
Linux and Windows (and likely MacOS).

The up-to-date version can be found at

* `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tifffile/>`_
* `C. Gohlke homepage <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/tifffile.py.html>`_


===============================
Tifffile
===============================

Read and write image data from and to TIFF files.

Image and metadata can be read from TIFF, BigTIFF, OME-TIFF, STK, LSM, NIH,
SGI, ImageJ, MicroManager, FluoView, SEQ and GEL files.
Only a subset of the TIFF specification is supported, mainly uncompressed
and losslessly compressed 2**(0 to 6) bit integer, 16, 32 and 64-bit float,
grayscale and RGB(A) images, which are commonly used in bio-scientific imaging.
Specifically, reading JPEG and CCITT compressed image data or EXIF, IPTC, GPS,
and XMP metadata is not implemented.
Only primary info records are read for STK, FluoView, MicroManager, and
NIH image formats.

TIFF, the Tagged Image File Format, is under the control of Adobe Systems.
BigTIFF allows for files greater than 4 GB. STK, LSM, FluoView, SGI, SEQ, GEL,
and OME-TIFF, are custom extensions defined by Molecular Devices (Universal
Imaging Corporation), Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Olympus, Silicon Graphics
International, Media Cybernetics, Molecular Dynamics, and the Open Microscopy
Environment consortium respectively.

For command line usage run ``python tifffile.py --help``

:Version: 2018.06.15

Requirements
------------
* `CPython 3.6 64-bit <https://www.python.org>`_
* `Numpy 1.14 <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `Matplotlib 2.2 <https://www.matplotlib.org>`_ (optional for plotting)
* `Tifffile.c 2018.02.10 <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/>`_
  (recommended for faster decoding of PackBits and LZW encoded strings)
* `Tifffile_geodb.py 2018.02.10 <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/>`_
  (optional enums for GeoTIFF metadata)
* Python 2 requires 'futures', 'enum34', 'pathlib'.

Installation
------------

This fork is intended to be a portable Python module, that is simply copied
where it is needed. It may be incorporated into a collection of tool
modules.

The only file that is necessary is 'tifffile.py', 
which should be placed in the Python search path. Reading of
certain TIFF files may be very slow; for speed-up also use the compiled
version of 'tifffile.c' (compilation instructions can be found there),
and copy the resulting '_tifffile' something into


Notes
-----
This is a an old, deprecated version of the code at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/tifffile.py.html.  

Tested on little-endian platforms only.

Other Python packages and modules for reading bio-scientific TIFF files:

*  `Imread <http://luispedro.org/software/imread>`_
*  `PyLibTiff <http://code.google.com/p/pylibtiff>`_
*  `SimpleITK <http://www.simpleitk.org>`_
*  `PyLSM <https://launchpad.net/pylsm>`_
*  `PyMca.TiffIO.py <http://pymca.sourceforge.net/>`_ (same as fabio.TiffIO)
*  `BioImageXD.Readers <http://www.bioimagexd.net/>`_
*  `Cellcognition.io <http://cellcognition.org/>`_
*  `CellProfiler.bioformats
   <https://github.com/CellProfiler/python-bioformats>`_

Known build errors
------------------
On Windows, the error `Error:unable to find vcvarsall.bat` means that distutils is not correctly configured to use the C compiler. Modify (or create, if not existing) the configuration file `distutils.cfg` (located for example at `C:\\Python27\\Lib\\distutils\\distutils.cfg`) to contain::

  [build]
  compiler=mingw32
